      <h2>Work flow</h2>
      <p>The group first met in the Zoom class <b>Tuesday 21st of October</b>. Before the meeting we had already started a WhatsApp chat and set up a GitHub repository. A simple Google search for "small dataset for students" led to us finding and curating our cereal file. During that first meeting we decided that Katarina would take responsibility for the algorithm, Irja would take charge on setting up the website and Sewalem will make sure that everything is published and submitted in Canvas. We decided on having a daily zoom meeting at 10 am weekdays, and then invite and meeting minutes were shared in the WhatsApp chat.</p>
      <p><b>Wednesday 22nd</b> we introduced the case to our fourth member, Dulakshi. It was decided that Sewalem would start to clean up our dataset and convert cups to ml. Irja would make the necessary web files, Katarina would make a first algorithm draft and Dulakshi would read up on the GitHub wiki and familiarise herself.</p>
      <p><b>Thursday 23rd</b> the website files had been set up, the dataset had been cleaned, a first algorithm draft had been made and Dulakshi had decided that she wanted to do some HTML. We talked about the algorithm choices that had been made and discussed some alternative solutions. We talked about meeting up once again after the workhop in the afternoon. That afternoon, we met our newest group member Anni. We shared our repository and talked about the progress so far. Since we are remote, we made it clear that anyone can work on any part of the project; no one owns the files. Text can and should be added to the webpages as we go even if the design is to be determined.</p>
      <p><b>Friday 24th</b> Katarina had other commitments. The group met and Anni started working on a navigation bar for the website. On <b>Monday 27th</b> Dulakshi had other commitments but the rest met. A navigation bar has been set up, Irja had started a mockup of the algorithm to make it easier to discuss what it does step-by-step. We decided to add an option to go back in the filtering process if the list should become empty. We also talked about discrepancies in attribute naming i.e. "H" in our dataset is "Hot" in our algorithm. Sewalem wanted to take a look at what level we should convert. Katarina signed up to do a table of group members to the people page, Irja wanted to start with the webdesign elements and Anni would make the final updates to the navigation bar and add it to the pages.</p>
