    <h1>Our Algorithm</h1>
    <p>Deciding what cereals to buy can be a nightmare if you don't know where to start. Our solution will make it easier to decide by narrowing down the choices. The algorithm provides a curated list of recommended cereals according to user preferences. </p>
    <h2>Attributes</h2>
    <p>There are four main attributes in our algorithm based on the dataset we curated:</p> 
      <list>
        
      <label for="cerealType">Choose your cereal type:</label><br />
      <input type="radio" id="hot" name="cerealType" value="H" />
      <label for="hot">H = Hot</label><br />

      <input type="radio" id="cold" name="cerealType" value="C" />
      <label for="cold">C = Cold</label>
        <li><b>type of cereal, string, "hot" or "cold"</b> Initial user preference of whether the user prefers hot cereal or cold cereal for breakfast</li> 
        <li><b>calories per serving, integer, 50</b> Defines how important calory intake is for the user, can help in finding low calory options if it is important</li> 
        <li><b>sugar content, float, 6.7</b> Is it important for the user that the cereals are sweet? If not let's suggest healthier options.</li>
        <li><b>fibre, float, 4.5</b> is our fourth attribute for the ones who need help with their gut health i.e fibre intake: </li>
      </list>
    
    <h2>UX and Flow</h2>
    <p>When asking the user about their preferences we could choose to either show results after each preference is answered and filtered, or we could choose to show the results after collecting all the answers to the questions. At first the idea was to use all filters at once but since we know that there aren't many hot options and that low calories and high sugars might become an impossible equation we decided on transparancy by showing the narrowing down for each step</p>
    <p>The type of cereal, hot or cold, should come first. We know there aren't many hot option so if someone prefers hot cereals this might be the only question needed to provide a narrow list. The users choosing cold will get more to choose from and will be prompted to answer the next question which is calories. It's an important factor for people trying to lose or maintain their weight, once again it could prove to narrow down the list enough for a result. The sweet tooth question is tying in nicely to the calories one, if calories aren't important to you then let's try it from the other side, is sugar important for you?</p>
    <p>For scalability reasons, we don't think it's advisable to show the full results after each question. Our dataset is small, but imagine a set with thousands of cereals. It would be overwhelming and not helpful for the user to see all the options. Inbetween questions it's enough to share how many cereals remain. Possibly with a bit of narrating on what the filter has done. The final list presented should contain all the attributes necessary for the user to make an informed decision.</p>
