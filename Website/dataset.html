<h1>Dataset</h1>
<p>Our dataset was found on Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals">80 cereals</a>. After studying the comment section and details we figured out that it most likely originates from the US in the 1990's. Most of the data is probably irrelevant today but the dataset is useful for this exercise.</p>
<p>First thing we decided to do was to clean up the irrelevant attributes: shelf and rating. The shelf refers to a physical store and the rating has an unclear origin. Second we decided to convert american cups to 100 ml to adapt to the euopean market</p>
