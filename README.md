# A case of data cerealisation
We have used the provided template for the course [*Datalogical Thinking*](https://www.hb.se/globalassets/global/international-office/kursplaner-ischool/ht23_datalogical-thinking-c3mdt1.pdf). We have used the dataset [*80 Cereals*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals) a CSV file with 77 cereals and their nutritional values.

## About the Assignment
For this assignments, we will work together to curate a dataset, and use pseudocode to design an algorithm to process that dataset in a meaningful way. We have been asked to publish our dataset and algorithm on GitHub, alongside a simple website with some basic information on our project, dataset, and algorithm -- to be hosted using GitHub Pages.

The course, in its current form, was designed by Wout Dillen, and taught for the first time in the autumn of 2023, with the help of his colleagues David Gunnarson Lorentzen, Kayvan Yousefi Mojir, Elisa Tattersall Wallin, and Anton Carlander Borgström.
